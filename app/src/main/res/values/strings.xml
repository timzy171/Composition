    <string name="game_rules">Rules of the game: there will be three figures in front of you, two from below and one from above, two of
        them will contain numbers. It is necessary that the sum of the numbers from the two lower figures be equal to the number
        in the upper figure. To do this, insert the missing number. \n\n\nExample: there is a number 7 in the upper circle, a question mark
        in one of the lower ones, and a number 4 in the other. So there should be a number 3 in place of the question mark, because 3 + 4 = 7</string>
